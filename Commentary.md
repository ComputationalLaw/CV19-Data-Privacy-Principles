## I. Introduction
## II. Short Glossary
### A. Definitions
#### 1. Contact-Tracing (Ryan and Nadia) Looking at past contacts of people with positive diagnosis
#### 2. Contact-Tracking - Forward looking, tracking people post positive diagnosis
#### 3. Public Health Emergency
#### 4. Consent - (Taylor) (Distinguish “A public health emergency (the condition that requires the governor to declare a state of public health emergency) is defined as "an occurrence or imminent threat of an illness or health condition, caused by bio terrorism, epidemic or pandemic disease, or (a) novel and highly fatal infectious agent or biological toxin, that poses a substantial risk of a significant number of human facilities or incidents or permanent or long-term disability (WHO/DCD, 2001). The declaration of a state of public health emergency permits the governor to suspend state regulations, change the functions of state agencies.” WHO (https://www.who.int/hac/about/definitions/en/)
#### 5. Deletion (Alexa) 
#### 6. Authority
##### a. Lawfulness (Dazza) 
##### b.Grant of Permission(Dazza) 
##### c. [[Noun form - as in “Dazza is an authority on identity” or “The Authorities have advised that people should wear masks.”]]
#### 7. Public Health Agency/Authority (Nadia in Canadian context) 
#### 8. Third-Party Doctrine (Mark)
##### a. In the United States, the “Third Party Doctrine” refers to the judicial holding that information deliberately shared with a third party loses the constitutional expectation of privacy
#### 9. Regulation (Mark)
#### 10. Statute (Mark)
#### 11. De-Identification - https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8053/final
#### 12. Anonymized Personal Data (Dazza)
#### 13. Aggregated Personal Data (Dazza) 
#### 14. Re-Identification of anonymized Individuals (decide if De-Anonymization is Better) (Dazza) ‘Reidentification concerns manipulating databases to determine the identity of individuals whose information is recorded as records within a deidentified database through data linkage techniques.’ (http://web.mit.edu/sem083/www/assignments/reidentification.html)
#### 15. At- Risk
Based on distance of signal, strength of signal and duration of contact, a belief that the contact has the possibility of infection
#### 16. Centralized
The Contact Tracing Entity has sole authority for collecting the contact tracing data,  and deposits it in a singular location.  The CTE issues a PIN # or equivalent for the initiation of a positive test
#### 17. Contact Tracers
A person or machine which will receive a positive test result from an individual and attempt to inform other individuals who have been deemed to be in close enough proximity to be considered at-risk
#### 18. Contact Tracing
In public health, contact tracing is the process of identification of persons who may have come into contact with an infected person and subsequent collection of further information about these contacts.
#### 19. Contact Tracing Entity (CTE)
a person or organization having power or control to conduct a contact tracing program
#### 20. Digital
characterized by electronic and especially computerized technology
#### 21. Digital Handshakes
he connections made between two Contact Tracing technology devices which record data
#### 22. Disabled Person
a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity
#### 23. Global Health Authority
WHO, or other CDC maybe
#### 24. Guardian
A person of legal age and ability who can act on behalf of an Underaged child or Disabled person in the matter of Contact Tracing
#### 25. Independent Governance
Independent means not influenced or controlled by others in matters of opinion, conduct, etc.; thinking or acting for oneself. Members of the governance body must not be affiliated with the entity providing the tracing systems. Further, if the government is the implementing authority, the independent panel should represent the people and have the means to be transparent, hear from and interact with the people. Governance means supervision; watchful care and the authority to call for change
#### 26. Jurisdiction
The legal region or geography in which a contact tracing program may be conducted
#### 27. Mandated
Mandated means that the authority or even technology provider leaves no choice to the user
#### 28. National Health Authority
CDC, NHS etc.
#### 29. Network Provider
Entity which delivers the signal between a device and the database, or the database and the Contact Tracer
#### 30. Non-Essential, Contracted
Entity which does not require data, personal data, or sensitive personal data to execute their contractual role in the Contact Tracing program
#### 31. Opt-In
Having the characteristic of individual choice free from coercion
#### 32. Pandemic
(of a disease) prevalent over a whole country or the world.
#### 33. Personal Data
Personal data, also known as personal information or personally identifiable information is any information relating to an identifiable person.
#### 34. Publicly	
As an adjective, open to all; notorious. Open to common use. Belonging to the people at large; relating to or affecting the whole people of a state, nation, or community; not limited or restricted to any particular class of the community.
#### 35. Registration
The first step acceptance and process to join the technology of an opt-in contact tracing system
#### 36. Sensitive Personal Data
Definition under the GDPR: data consisting of racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
#### 37. Service Provider
A Third-party technology provider who is supplying critical infrastructure and services to the Contact Tracing technology
#### 38. Start Date
The day and time at which a contact tracing program is initiated
#### 39. Underaged
A child who has not reached the minimum age for the contact tracing program
## III. Principles
### A. Lawfulness
#### 1. What is the lawful basis for use of this app by public sector health authorities?
##### a. Note that in some countries the authority (doing the tracing?) is the police (Greece) and the corresponding legal authority and framework differs
##### b. We should provide opinions on the best fit authorities to do this type of work. Like a guideline? Multiple contributors believe this is important (especially in view of some police using contact tracing as justification for arrest of protesters to see where they are coming from). Contact tracing should not be used for police powers.
##### c. What about use by law enforcement of weaponizing CT solutions to “tag” protestors, dissenters, etc…  (Similar to the state campaign and anti-competition uses of malicious)
##### d. Note - in Canada it is very clear what CT scope exists (Nadia) But intel agencies can apply to court to get warrants. Please note that there has...
##### e. Ryan - Separation, when possible, between the Authority declaring the Health Emergency (recognizing that this is optimal, but not always practical)(Audit Questions 1-8)
##### f. Independent Audit and Governance of Contact Tracing is useful for bridging the “trust gap” between adoption and minimal effective level (60% according to Brookings).  Further, Independent Audit and Governance should enhance the ability to avoid mission creep, data misappropriation and general misuse.
#### 2. Certification for who can be a contact tracer to improve trust as an option (not totally sure what this means)
#### 3. Declaration of a public health emergency
#### 4. Model State Emergency Health Powers Act: Section 302 Tracking; (d) Enforcement.  “The public health authority may enforce the provisions of this Section in accordance w/ existing enforcement rules and regulations.  An order of the public health authority given to effectuate the purposes of this Section shall be enforceable immediately by the public safety authority.” Public health x policing
#### 5. “this was the misinformation that went viral about the [HR6666](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6666/text) bill but appears to be coming true. ie contact tracing as a tool is being misappropriated and misused” There was a viral campaign re this bill for CT funding, the campaign against it was people would use this to separate families. (Ajintha) 
#### 6. Taylor - there may be something under NY law that comes into play here in which there could be usage of police power to separate (quarantine) members of families.
### B. Consent
#### 1. How do we manage _informed consent_?
##### a. Collecting manually like verbal?
##### b. Ryan - Consent needs to be layered and explained (Audit Q88, Q96):
###### i. Voluntary usage/download (Audit Q21, Q97)
###### ii. Consent at registration (Audit Q98)
###### iii. Opt-in/Opt Out (without deletion) at any time (Audit Q33,Q117)
###### iv. Delete/Opt Out permanently anytime (Audit Q36,Q39-40,
###### v. Opt In to upload positive test (Audit Q34)
###### vi. Opt-In for extension of Contact Tracing Program beyond Expiry date (Audit Q141)
###### vii. Opt-In for anonymized or aggregate data for analysis (Audit Q116)
#### 2. Kelsey: Which norms should govern in which situation
##### a. Manual like verbal
##### b. Completely through the app? (traditional digital consent flow)
##### c. Medical consent / IRB type consent (academic flow) 
##### d. Note: A sorta privacy Miranda warning?
#### 3. Options in Response to 2 (above)
##### a. Dynamic Informed Consent (Ajintha)
##### b. Entity collecting consent in digital world will keep proof of consent (date/time) vs. manual world (lots of admin)
##### c. PathCheck tracer could have a dynamic build to track granular consent that could even have some documentation from somebody with a PoA or other medical guardian, somebody standing in loco parentis…
#### 4. Need to talk about how to revoke consent.
##### a. Should be easy
###### i. There was a virtual “big red button” in the app
###### ii. However, it wasn’t super clear about all the things for which consent had been granted AND what is achieved by the revocation of consent do
What would stay?
What would go away?
###### iii. Cari prefers a “giant kill switch” to then allow for granular consent.
###### iv. Ajintha - there’s a delete button and a consent toggle with explanatory information.
###### v. Understanding of the Digital footprint or digital shadow - your unique set of traceable digital activities, actions, contributions and communications manifested on the Internet or on digital devices. Hard to purge. 
##### b. Wording should be clear
##### c. Nadia  - [Canadian example of consent](https://www.cmpa-acpm.ca/en/advice-publications/handbooks/consent-a-guide-for-canadian-physicians#:~:text=The%20doctrine%20of%20informed%20consent,%E2%80%94%20is%20to%20be%20administered.%22) - implied, voluntary and express: See the definitions here: Implied Consent v Expressed Consent v Voluntary Medical Protective Association,  Consent: a Guide for Physicians. “Canadian health care privacy legislation is comprised of 14 government jurisdictions (the Federal Government, 10 Provinces, and 3 Territories) each with its own legislative framework for protecting the privacy of personal information ("PI"), or personal health information ("PHI").”
##### d. Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada - [Privacy Laws in Canada](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/) in general.

##### e. Canadian provinces and territories have their own legislation and albeit similar in most respects, are not fully harmonized. 
###### i. British Columbia: _[Personal Information Protection Act](http://healthinfoprivacybc.ca/)_
When consent is needed: [to give care and treatment](http://healthinfoprivacybc.ca/consent/when-consent-is-needed)
When consent is not needed: [emergencies, billing, research, etc.](http://healthinfoprivacybc.ca/consent/when-consent-isnt-needed)
###### ii. Alberta: _[Health Information Act](https://www.alberta.ca/health-information-act.aspx)_
###### iii. Saskatchewan: _[The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP)](https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/products/527)_ and _[The Health Information Protection Act (HIPA)](https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/products/4523)_
###### vi. Manitoba: _[The Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)](http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/p033-5e.php)_ and [The Personal Health Information Regulation](http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/regs/index.php?act=p33.5). This regulation has no legislative sanction and the original should be consulted for purposes of interpreting and applying the law.
##### v. Ontario: [Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario](https://www.ipc.on.ca/) _[Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/04p03)_ general limitations on the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information.
###### vi. Quebec: _[Act respecting the sharing of certain health information](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/P-9.0001)_ and _[Québec Health Record Access to Information and Rectification Policy](http://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-001123/)_

###### ix. Newfoundland and Labrador: _[Personal Health Information Act](http://www.health.gov.nl.ca/health/phia/)_
###### x. Prince Edward Island: _[Health Information Act](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/legislation/h-01-41-health_information_act.pdf)_
###### xi. Yukon: _[Health Information Privacy and Management Act](http://www.hss.gov.yk.ca/pdf/hipma-act.pdf)_
###### xii. Northwest Territories: _[Health Information Act](https://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/en/files/legislation/health-information/health-information.a.pdf)_ and [Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act](https://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/en/access-to-information-held-by-public-bodies/)_
###### xiii. Nunavut: _[Access to Information and Protection of Privacy (ATIPP) Act](https://www.nunavutlegislation.ca/en/download/file/fid/11654)_
##### f. _[Rogers v Whitaker](http://www.paci.com.au/downloads_public/court/12_Rogers_v_Whitaker.pdf) case (Australia), _[Montgomery](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2013-0136-judgment.pdf)_ (UK) could be persuasive authorities here). When discussing this part of the test, Lords Kerr and Reed referred to and borrowed heavily from Rogers v Whitaker from the High Court in Australia in which a patient, who was already blind in the eye scheduled for surgery, was not warned of the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia (thought to be the cause of Louis Braille’s blindness) that could (and ultimately did) result in blindness in their good eye. It is very reasonable to presume that being blind in one eye would affect someone’s attitude to the risk of blindness in their other eye, and the surgeon clearly knew about it.  “Written consent” is considered superior to “verbal consent”. 
##### g. Supreme Court in Montgomery to state that a doctor must make a patient aware of any material risks, and the test of materiality is whether “a reasonable person in the patient’s position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it.” Montgomery endorsed the fact that it is not for the doctor to determine which information should be disclosed to the patient In the 2017 case Shaw vs Kovac, the judges determined that “it has long been the law that where a doctor has failed to provide proper information as to risk prior to a medical procedure and that failure leads to consent being given which otherwise would have been with held, and loss results, then that is actionable in negligence”
##### h. In an article “Informed Consent and Nudging” by William Simkulet, the practice of “nudging” was defined as “any influence designed to predictably alter a person's behavior without limiting their options or giving them reasons to act” with the author arguing that “nudging is incompatible with genuine informed consent, as it violates a physician's obligation to tell their patients the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth during adequate disclosure”. “ nudges can to a certain extent diminish individuals’ autonomy”.  
##### i. Pagona - Consent means different things in different laws, and in different jurisdictions. (related to Nadia’s point re Canadian guidance on medical consent gradations)
###### i. Different tiers of consent for different things.
###### ii. GDPR, for instance, requires explicit consent
For instance, explicit consent for each piece of data and its use.
###### iii. Since GDPR is, in many senses, a floor, not a ceiling, varying jurisdictions have adopted different approaches. 
How will we get a jurisdiction that does not have rules as restrictive as others to agree to the more restrictive rules
###### iv. Ryan - Italian app, governed by GDPR, does not have specific consent for aggregate/anonymized data
###### v. From a normative perspective, there has not been a lot of GDPR enforcement, the guidance will be especially important - guidance should carefully use words like “shall” when we believe there is an absolute goal.  Many places may just agree to adhere to the higher standard.
### C. Right to Control
#### 1. De-identification/Anonymization/Aggregation and Re-identification
##### a. HHS and NIST frameworks 
##### b. Human Dynamics methods of re-identification
##### c. Potential for red-teaming to battle-test and diligence risk management against re-identification 
#### 2. Decentralization / Distribution of data as a bulwark against becoming a honey-pot target and against unconsented use.
##### a. Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation: Decentralized systems could facilitate compliance with the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation, respectively.  These principles find their technical equivalent in so-called “privacy by design strategies” (i.e. strategies aimed at embedding data protection principles in the design of the technology) to “minimize” and “separate” personal data processing. The first strategy aims to minimize the amount of personal data processed, the second one aims to make it harder to “combine or correlate data”. Consider currently available technology systems that incorporate privacy by design strategies. See Special Note on Privacy Capabilities of Emerging Technologies, below.  ALSO See special note on Open Algorithms below.
##### b. User Agency and Interoperability: As a balance against data minimization and purpose limitation, which can prevent the use, combination or correlation of data in ways that may be harmful to the user, decentralized systems could also facilitate an emphasis on user agency and interoperability to support the sharing of data in ways that benefit the user. To support the benefits of sharing of data, while allowing users to exercise their rights to control their data, and also ensuring a competitive, innovative, dynamic marketplace in products and services around contact tracing, applications and policies should also be designed to promote adversarial interoperability.
#### 3. Sharing data w/Health Authority
##### a. Redaction
##### b. Limit of use 
##### c. Duration of retention
##### d. Opt In required (Audit Q116) only if anonymized and aggregated
##### e. Donation of data upon deletion (Audit Q 226)
#### 4. Sharing data w/ others?
##### a. Uncovered by Audit Q 113,114,115,116,118)
#### 5. Deletion - Can you vis-à-vis data retention laws?  (Audit Q36,39,40,42-45)
##### a. What does deletion mean, has the Authority defined it? (Audit Q 42)
##### b. Deleting the app deletes the data where?
###### i. On device? (Audit Q 39)
###### ii. On centralized database? (Audit Q40)
##### 6. Stewardship, decision-making, use
##### 7. Ability to request record, know who has seen records, modify records, and delete records
### D. Transparency
#### 1. Scope/Purpose and Measurement Criteria
##### a. Minimization
###### i. What data is collected? 
###### ii. DP3T Protocol - The SwissCOVID app has been built using DP-3T protocol to complement manual contact tracing. In a decentralized approach, by comparison, “the system does not reveal any information about the interaction between two users to any entity other than the two users themselves”. The user does have the option to voluntarily share data and in that sense sharing can be enabled with say research bodies who may need a centralised dataset to enable epidemiological insights to be developed or shared to a machine computable format. Providing consent mechanisms and optionality could provide avenues for minimum “purpose” driven data sharing. 
##### b. How long is data kept for these CT? The current version of Swiss Covid app retains the data for 21 days allowing them to be notified if they have come into close contact with infected people..
##### c. Updates and Changes
#### 2. Notice
##### a. Updates and Changes
##### b. Recertification of fitness for purpose
##### c. User-friendly language, use of layers and visuals if possible 
#### 3. Use of Aggregated Data
#### 4. Auditing - A comprehensive audit of contact tracing technology has been developed.  It covers seven (7) key areas:
##### a. Ethics
##### b. Bias
##### c. Privacy
##### d. Trust 
##### e. Cybersecurity
##### f. Launch protocol
##### g. Expiry Protocol
##### h. Contact Tracing Technology details	
#### 5. Accessibility 
##### a. For the Visually impaired (Audit Q 104)
##### b. For different languages (Audit Q 100-103)
##### c. Reasonable language standards (Audit Q 99,100,219 multiple other questions)
##### d. Privacy Policy disclosure (Audit Q 99,219)
##### e. Availability of App/Cost  (Audit Q 26-29)
##### f. Visual expression of complex technology (Audit Q 87)
##### g. FAQs (Audit Q 106)
### E. Accountability (As in data controllers under GDPR)
#### 1. Risk Example - false “hot zones” to troll an area - how to prevent/hold accountable?
#### 2. Ryan: Independent audit and governance w/appropriate documentation and process, and ability of independent auditors to shoot flares/bang drums, etc.
##### a. How can compliance and audit be interoperable and more standards based to set conditions for more opportunities for external/independent parties to perform governance and audit functions?
##### b. Can/should there be certification or accreditation for players providing independent audit or governance as service? 
###### i. Any competent body promulgating transparent audit standards can apply for a certification mark to grant the negative right of IP protection to prevent any fraudulent claims of passing an audit/certification.
#### 3. Contracts!  Ways to render assertions enforceable by contract
#### 4. Unfair and deceptive trade practices enforcement, eg in US: FTC enforcement
#### 5. Bills in the Senate and affordances of rights of action (private causes of action) (attorneys general!)(avoid SLAPP suits…)
##### a. Statutory Issues/measures:
###### i. Explicit restrictions on how data may be used
###### ii. Suppression remedy/exclusionary rule with regards to data improperly shared with law enforcement
###### iii. Statutory right to Data Subject Access Request
###### iv. Clear and controlling legislation/regulation which states how contact tracing data will be used in an aggregate or anonymized form with associated consents
###### v. Criminal or civil punishments or sanctions for misuse or improper sharing of contact tracing data with an appropriate mens rea standard
###### vi. Criminal or civil sanction for those who report or cause the reporting of inaccurate or misleading information to a contact tracing program when the parties in question knew or had reason to know that the information was false.
###### vii. Suspension of any statutory data retention rules that may otherwise attach to contact tracing data
#### 6. Document and demonstrate compliance (GDPR Accountability principle)
#### 7. Certification and audit
### F. Proportionality
#### 1. What would be the units of measure for the efficacy of a CT app, and the privacy elements.
##### a. Under the auspices of Independent Audit and Governance of Contact Tracing, proportionality can be set aside in lieu of consultation and remediation.  Contact Tracing is a valuable tool of public health and it is in the public’s interest that all possible steps are taken to operate a efficacious contact tracing system.
#### 2. How do we balance?
##### a. Efficacy and utility in reducing incidence of new cases
###### i. What are the measures of utility (consult public health measures and basic epidemiology)
###### ii. What are examples of low, medium and high utility?
###### iii. What factors are valid for attributing utility to the app?
##### b. Risk to privacy
###### i. What are the measures of risk to privacy?
###### ii. What are examples of low, medium and high utility?
###### iii. What factors are valid for attributing privacy risk to the app?
##### c. Factors to consider when determining utility (Bryan can explain this)
###### i. Scope
###### ii. Purpose
###### iii. Types of data collected
###### iv. Collection processes
###### v. Sharing
###### vi. Retention
###### vii. Deletion
What is the period of time contact data can be maintained?  
#### 3. Workplace Safety and Reopening the Economy?
##### a. How do these factors change when considering potential uses for contact tracing
###### i. Workplace context -- employer & employees
##### b. Jurisdictional Issues
#### 4. GDPR Legitimate Interest Assessment may be a useful tool to perform the proportionality assessment - see ICO template [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/legitimate-interests/how-do-we-apply-legitimate-interests-in-practice/)
## IV. Special Note on Equity, Fairness and Anti-Discrimination 
### A. A data ethics evaluation should be performed due to the sensitivity of the data collected and the fear of this data being used negatively against users. One of the purposes of the Privacy Principles is to minimize this risk; however, there are unseen risks that technology can create, for example as a result of inherent bias or singular vision. Participation in the use of an app should be equal and fair to all potential users, especially for underrepresented groups, who are typically the most susceptible to unintended harms. Proactive measures should be taken to recognize and minimize bias, discrimination, and unintended consequences. To help guide the development of an equitable app deployment, we recommend the use of a data ethics framework. Some examples include  [EthicalOS](https://ethicalos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ethical-OS-Toolkit-2.pdf), the [Markkula Ethical Toolkit for Engineering/Design Practice](https://www.scu.edu/ethics-in-technology-practice/ethical-toolkit/), the [Digital Impact Toolkit](https://digitalimpact.io/toolkit/), the [Ethics and Algorithms Toolkit](https://ethicstoolkit.ai/), and the [Microsoft Responsible Innovation Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/responsible-innovation/). (Footnote this perhaps)(just discovered a lot of good toolkits listed [here](https://blog.einstein.ai/frameworks-tool-kits-principles-and-oaths-oh-my/))
