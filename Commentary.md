        * What would be the units of measure for the efficacy of a CT app, and the privacy elements. 
        * How do we balance?
            * Efficacy and utility in reducing incidence of new cases
                * What are the measures of utility (consult public health measures and basic epidemiology)
                * What are examples of low, medium and high utility?
                * What factors are valid for attributing utility to the app?
            * Risk to Privacy
                * What are the measures of risk to privacy?

            * How do these factors change when considering potential uses for contact tracing
                * Workplace context -- employer & employees
            * Jurisdictional Issues
3. Other Pillars
    * Voluntary
